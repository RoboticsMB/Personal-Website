	<p>Thank you for visiting my personal website. This site currently provides a quick overview of myself
my projects, my interests, as well as my general education.
For a brief outline of my work experience, please see the "Experience Page". For a summary of my accomplishments and general education please see the "About Page". And for a more compact version of my achievements

	<h2 class = "follow-up-portion">What I'm up to right now</h2>
	<p>Currently, I am submitting scholarship applications and continue to actively participate in my extracurriculars. Our Chess Team just finished another undefeated season, and our varsity tennis team, won our section, placed 2nd in WPIAL Championships, and made it to the 2nd round of the state bracket.
I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my skills in CS, and have just recently accepted an offer for a part-time apprenticeship at Simcoach Games!</p>
