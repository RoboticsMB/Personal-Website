	<h2 class = "follow-up-portion">What I'm up to right now</h2>
	<p>Currently I am volunteering at a summer stem program, where I assist in teaching various CS principles to children.
I also assist in teaching at a few chess camps. And of course I am beggining to prepare
college applications. I am always on the market for new ways to improve my skillsets in CS. Especially any internships.</p>
